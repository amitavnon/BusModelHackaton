Optimizing Public Transportation Routes


Motivation: Better Public Transportation
Youâ€™ve always wondered why you can wait for 1 hour for the 9 bus from Rehavia, only to find
that three of them arrive together one after the other, why some buses are packed while others are
constantly empty, why getting to Mount Scopus can take a whole day, why the bus driver always
closes the back door before the last passenger boarded, or in general whether public transportation
in Israel can be improved. After 8 weeks of the IML course, you decide that machine learning can
help with (at least some) of these problems! So you start the HU.BER company, which will use
machine learning skills learned at the HU to improve various aspects of public transportation.


Tasks:
1. Predicting Passenger Boardings at Bus Stops
2. Predicting Trip Duration
